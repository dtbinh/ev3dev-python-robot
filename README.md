# Robo Challenge Hackathon
Welcome to the EV3 __Robo Challenge Hackathon__ starter project. This project contains [ev3dev](http://www.ev3dev.org/) code snippets 
for the EV3 intelligent brick. You can use these examples to get started in the robo challenge hackathon.

## Course of action (36 hours)
The robot challenge hackathon is a 36 hours hackathon, in which different teams compete with their EV3 robots against each other. 
There are three main challenges. Each challenges has several rounds (sprints). After each round the teams have some time to 
improve their robot. 

## Main rules
First rule of robo challenge, have fun and learn how to code in a team and improve your code in several iterations. 

Now the main rules:  
- The kits are provided and no additional kits or bricks are allowed.
- During the competition no connection to the EV3 brick (wifi, bluetooth, etc.) is allowed.
- If the brick or algorithm crashes, no restart or manual interaction is allowed.
- For every challenge the teams get points, depending on the challenge the number of points can change.
